All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [9.161] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **CloudIO watchdog no longer stops permanently on HTTP 204.** When the
  `/devices/config` sync returned 204 (device not adopted — or a transient
  server-side condition such as a deploy or database pressure), the firmware
  called `stopCloudIOWatchdog()` and never retried the cloud connection again:
  the device stayed connected to the local broker (Home Assistant kept working)
  but disappeared from CloudIO until a manual power cycle or a WiFi drop.
  Affected mainly HAN/PZEM energy meters, whose frequent MQTT reconnects made
  them far more likely to hit a bad window. The watchdog now backs off for
  ~30 minutes after a 204 and then asks again, forever. A successful sync
  clears the backoff.

## [9.17] - 2026-02-14

### Release
- Promoted stable release from `9.17-dev`.
- Includes CloudIO/webpanel/build-flow improvements from the 9.17 development cycle.
- Added `## [9.17]` release section to satisfy strict release validation checks.
- Verified all configured PlatformIO environments build successfully for the 9.17 release snapshot.


### Webpanel
- Replaced `parseFloat` version compare with robust parser/comparator for `-dev` formats.
- Removed hardcoded API base URL and switched to same-origin requests.

### Code Quality
- Replaced deprecated ArduinoJson `containsKey()` checks with `isNull()` guards in config update flow.
- Added explicit ESP8266 no-op switch cases for ESP32-only drivers (`TMF882X`, `LD2410`) to clear switch warnings.

### Process and Release
- Added `docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` with CP/PR workflow steps.
- Added branch naming convention for CP branches.
- Added release checklist in repo docs.
- Added `tools/generate_release_notes.sh` to create `RELEASE_NOTES_DRAFT.md` from git history.

## [9.163] - Stable baseline

- Baseline before `9.17-dev` maintenance and build-flow updates.
